# Unit 3: Fisheries Collapse Module

This module will focus on understanding and replicating 
fisheries stock assessment data and fisheries collapse. 

Instead of working with independent dataframes, we will be working with a large
relational database which contains many different tables of different sizes and 
shapes, but that all all related to eachother through a series of different ids.


## The Database
We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](http://ramlegacy.marinebiodiversity.ca/ram-legacy-stock-assessment-database)

First, load in the necessary librarys. Note that this time we need a package we 
haven't used before `readxl`. This package is useful for reading in .xls or 
.xlsx files. As always if you want more info on a package run `?readxl` after 
loading it.

```{r message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
```

## Reading in the tables

First thing, you are going to need to download and unzip the files. Although you don't need 
to do this step more than once, Travis will need this code to be able to reproduce you work successfully,
unless you choose to push the datafiles up to git. 

```{r}
download.file("https://depts.washington.edu/ramlegac/wordpress/databaseVersions/RLSADB_v3.0_(assessment_data_only)_excel.zip", 
              "ramlegacy.zip")
path <- unzip("ramlegacy.zip")  #unzip the .xls files
sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(path) #use the readxl package to identify sheet names 
ram <- lapply(sheets, readxl::read_excel, path = path)  #read the data from all 3 sheets into a list
names(ram) <- sheets # give the list of datatables their assigned sheet names

## check your names
names(ram)

## check your data
head(ram$area)

```

Side Note: You may notice the `lapply` function above. This function applies a given function
(in this case "read_excel") to all elements in a vector or list. This is the same 
as writing out read_excel for all 17 of the sheets contained in our file, or writing
a for loop `for(i in 1:length(sheets)){read_excel(sheets[i])}`. These are very powerful
functions we will learn more about later. For now, it's enough to recognize why we
have used it here. You can find more info in [Chapter 21 of the R4ds
book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html). 

# Exercise 1: Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

Now we are ready to dive into our data.  First, We seek to replicate the following 
figure from the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data. 

![](http://berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88b/fish/img/codcollapse.jpg)

## Task 1: Joining the necessary data

To replicate this plot, we need a table with the following information: 
- The species harvested 
- the total catch *per year* (TC)
- the spawning-stock-biomass *per year* (SSB)
- the country, region, and/or area that the fish were harvested by/from

The columns that contain this information are spread across the ram database. 
To get this data together we are going to need to use joins. 
A good way forward is to think about what data 
we most care about (what do we want to end up plotting??? look above!), start with
that and join as needed to pull together all the information. 

Hint: the values of total catch and ssb per year are found in the `timeseries_values_views`
table. 

Using the `select()` and `join()` functions you were introduced to in in Module 1,
build a tidy table with the desired columns. 

```{r}
 
```

I ended up with a table that had the following column names (some of which I needed to rename
in the process!):  `country`, `areaname`, `ssb_unit`, `TC_unit`, 
`scientificname`, `commonname`, `year`, `ssb`, and `TC`. Your columns might be different
just make sure you contain the info listed above!

## Task 2: Subsetting our data by regional id and species name 

In order to replicate the collapse of Atlantic Cod, we are interested in the 
data from Atlantic Cod harvests in Canada. 

Using the table you built above, `filter()` those records of Atlantic Cod caught in
Canada. 

```{r}

```


## Task 3: Plotting Total Catch in Canada

Calculate and plot the Canadian catch of Atlantic Cod (in million tons (MT)) through time using 
your new datatable. 

Hint: you may want to use functions like `group_by()`, `filter()`, and/or `summarise()`

```{r }


```

**Question:** How does this graph compare to the one presented above?

# Exercise 2: Group Assignment

## Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](http://berkeley.carlboettiger.info/espm-88b/img/worm2006.png)

**Question 1:** What years does this plot include? What is it plotting? 

## Task 1: Plotting total taxa caught worldwide 1950-2006

Adapting the table you created in the first exercise, select and 
manipulate the necessary columns to plot the number of total taxa caught each year 
from 1950 til 2006 using `geom_point()`. 

Hint: you may want to use functions like `group_by()`, `tally()` and be sure to 
carefully consider how to handle or omit missing values. 

```{r}

```

## Task 2: Removing incomplete datasets

Species can either have missing data (within a series) or a time range 
that just doesn't span the full interval. Grouping by stockid instead of year, 
build a character vector containing only those stockids that have data for the 
full range (1950-2006).


```{r}

```

**Question 2:** How many taxa have data for the full range?

```{r}

```


## Task 3: Which fisheries have collapsed?

A fishery may be considered *collapsed* when total catch (TC) falls
below 10% of its peak. For those stocks with complete data sets, create a new 
tidy table including columns: `stockid`, `TC`, `year`, `collapsed`, and `cumulative`, 
where `collapsed` is a logical (True or False) for whether or not that fishery could
be considered collapsed in that year, and `cumulative` is the count of total years
the fishery has been collapsed at that point in time. 

```{r}

```

## Task 4: Plotting total catch

Using `geom_area()` plot the TC per stockid acros all years. 
```{r}

```

## Task 5: Calculating percent collapsed

To replicate the original plot, we must calculate the percent of taxa 
collapsed over time.
Using the `summarise()` function, and only the core stocks that have data 
across the full interval, build a new tidy table
that gives the fraction of all stocks that are collapsed in each year and 
include a cumulative column that gives the fraction of all years (between 1950 and each year)
that has experience at least one collapse. 

Hint: when logical vectors are summed or converted to numerics, TRUE = 1 and FALSE = 0.

```{r}

```

## Task 6: Plotting proportion collapsed over time. 

Using `geom_line` twice to plot two individual lines (of different
colors please), plot the cumulative number of collapsed fisheries through time
and the fraction of collapsed fishers through time on the same graph.

Hint: try using `scale_y_reverse()` to flip the y axis for a different perspective
on these fractions.

```{r}


```

**Question 3:** What does this graph show us? How is it presenting information differently than the original graph for this exercise? Is it presenting the same information?
